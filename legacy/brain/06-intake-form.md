# Intake Form — `intake.html`

_Last updated: 2026-04-17_

Version 1 of Matt's client-intake tool. First deliverable of the Monday Automation Strategy.

---

## Purpose

A single, shareable, link-based form that lets Matt collect everything he needs to price a job — project vision, dimensions, Decore door/finish/hardware selection, materials, appliance packets, and budget tolerances — in one sitting, replacing email back-and-forth. Submissions save directly to the Saunders Supabase database.

**Site plumbing & appliances (agent context):** Internal references `docs/combined-plumbing.pdf` and `docs/combined-appliances.pdf` map to **site notes**, **dimensions**, and **Appliance Packets**; see `10-site-plumbing.md` and `11-site-appliances.md` for how agents should use them without replacing per-model manufacturer PDFs.

## In-page JS catalogs

All catalog constants are defined at the top of the `<script>` block. When a product changes in Decore's line, update **both** the relevant `brain/` doc and the matching constant here.

| Constant | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| `DECORE_DOORS` | `brain/02-decore-doors.md` + `brain/products.json#/doors` |
| `DECORE_FINISHES` | `brain/03-decore-finishes.md` + `brain/products.json#/finishes` |
| `DRAWER_BOX_CATALOG` | `brain/04-decore-hardware.md` + `brain/products.json#/drawerBoxes` |
| `HARDWARE_CATALOG` | `brain/04-decore-hardware.md` + `brain/products.json#/hardware` |
| `PRICE_CATALOG` | Saunders shop prices — no Decore source; update manually or via future live feed |

## State shape

The full form state is a single JS object persisted to localStorage and saved as `state_json` in Supabase:

```json
{
  "basics":    { "name", "email", "phone", "address", "projectType", "targetDate", "narrative", "siteNotes" },
  "dims":      { "unit": "in" },
  "components":   [{ "id", "label", "L", "W", "H", "D", "notes" }],
  "doors":        [{ "id", "componentId", "styleKey", "type", "qty", "width", "height", "finish", "sheen", "unitPrice" }],
  "drawerBoxes":  [{ "id", "componentId", "modelKey", "width", "depth", "height", "qty", "unitPrice" }],
  "materials":    [{ "id", "componentId", "materialKey", "qty", "L", "W", "H", "quotedPrice" }],
  "hardware":     [{ "id", "category", "itemKey", "variant", "qty", "unitPrice" }],
  "decoreSpec": { "panelDetail", "insideEdge", "outsideFaceEdge", "outsideBackEdge", "borePattern", "borePosition", "dfGrain", "shipping", "shipDate", "notes" },
  "appliancePackets": [{ "name", "url", "uploadedAt" }],
  "budget":     { "target", "labor", "contingencyPct", "wigglePct", "projectTolerancePct", "showDrops" }
}
```

## Roadmap

| Version | Scope |
|---|---|
| **v1** (current) | Self-contained form, Supabase save, appliance PDF upload |
| **v2** | POST to Monday.com — auto-creates Lead → Project record |
| **v3** | Conversational mode — type "12 Shaker maple, 18×30, Smoky Blue satin" → form fills itself |
| **v4** | Auto-submit to Decore — generate pre-filled order form PDF, Matt approves in one click |
